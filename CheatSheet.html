    <h3>What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?</h3>
    <p>
        The most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web a success include:

        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): Used to structure and format web content.
        Uniform Resource Locator (URL): Provides a standardized way to address web resources.
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/HTTPS): Facilitates the transfer of data between web servers and clients.
        Web Browsers: Software that interprets and displays web content to users.
        Search Engines: Tools that help users discover and navigate web resources effectively.
    </p>

    <h3>How are resources (html pages, images, etc) addressed in the web?</h3>
    <p>
        Resources on the web, such as HTML pages and images, are addressed using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). It usually consists of many components, including the protocol (for example: http:// or https://), the domain or host name (e.g., www.example.com), and the path to the specific resource on the server.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the general components of a url?</h3>
    <p>
        The general components of a URL are the protocol, domain (or host), port (optional), path, query parameters (optional), and fragment identifier (optional). For example, in the URL "https://www.example.com:8080/path/page?param=value#section," "https" is the protocol, "www.example.com" is the domain, "8080" is the port, "/path/page" is the path, "param=value" is a query parameter, and "section" is a fragment identifier.

    <!-- Web Server -->
    <h2>Web Server</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is a web server?</h3>
    <p>
        A web server is a software application or hardware device wich stores, processes, and serves web content to clients over the internet. It waits for incoming requests from web clients (like web browsers) and responds by delivering webpages or files or data.
    </p>

    <h3>What does a web server do?</h3>
    <p>
        A web server primarily serves web content by processing incoming HTTP or HTTPS requests from web clients. It retrieves requested resources, processes server-side scripts if needed, and sends the appropriate response (for example HTML pages, images, or other files) back to the client.
    </p>

    <h3>How can content be stored on a web server?</h3>
    <p>
        Content can be stored on a web server in various ways, typically as files in directories on the server's file system. Additionally some web servers use databases to store dynamic content, while others may generate content on-the-fly using server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Node.js.
    </p>

    <h3>How is content in webpages described?</h3>
    <p>
        Content in webpages is described using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), wich defines the structure and layout of web documents. HTML tags and elements are used to format some text, insert images, create hyperlinks, and define the overall structure of the page.

    <!-- Web Client -->
    <h2>Web Client</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is a web client?</h3>
    <p>
        A web client is a software application or program that requests and retrieves web content from web servers. Web browsers are a common example of web clients, but other applications like email clients or mobile apps can also act as web clients.
    </p>

    <h3>What does a web client do?</h3>
    <p>
        A web client is responsible for sending HTTP or HTTPS requests to web servers to retrieve webpages, files, or data. It then interprets and displays the received content to the user, making it accessible and interactive.
    </p>

    <h3>Web Client and Web Browser is the same?</h3>
    <p>
        While a web client is a broader term, a web browser is a specific type of web client that is normally used for viewing and interacting with web content in a graphical user interface.

    <h3>What are the two top most elements within the html element?</h3>
    <p>
        To emphasize text in HTML, you can use the >em> element for semantic emphasis. The text enclosed within >em> tags is typically displayed in italics by web browsers.
